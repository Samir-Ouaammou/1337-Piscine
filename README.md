1337 Piscine - My Journey

Welcome to my repository! This README is a reflection of my journey during the 1337 Piscine experience, where I pushed my limits, learned essential programming skills, and grew as a problem solver.

🚀 About the 1337 Piscine

The Piscine ("swimming pool" in French) is a 4-week intensive coding bootcamp that serves as a gateway into the 1337 programming school. It challenges participants with:

Intensive coding challenges

Collaboration with peers

Daily exercises, evaluations, and exams

The Piscine is more than a test of programming skills—it's a test of perseverance, teamwork, and self-discipline.

🧠 What I Learned

During the Piscine, I developed skills in:

C Programming

Pointers and memory management

Functions and recursion

String manipulation and file I/O

Linux & Shell

Navigating the command line

Bash scripting

File permissions and system tools

Git & Version Control

Managing code versions with Git

Collaborating on projects

Problem Solving

Breaking down complex problems into smaller, solvable parts

Debugging and optimizing code

🏆 Key Projects & Challenges

Here are some of the standout projects and challenges I completed during the Piscine:

Shell00: Introduction to basic file commands and scripting.

C Projects:

Libft: Rebuilding essential C library functions.

Exam Practice: Tackling real-time coding exams with limited time.
