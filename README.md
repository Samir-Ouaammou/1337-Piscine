🏆 Key Achievements
💻 Technical Skills Developed
C Programming:
Mastered syntax, loops, functions, and recursion.
Improved understanding of pointers, memory allocation, and file I/O.
Debugged complex programs using tools like gdb and Valgrind.
Shell Scripting:
Learned essential Unix commands (e.g., ls, grep, awk, sed).
Automated workflows using Bash scripts.
Managed file permissions, processes, and shell environments.
Git & Version Control:
Mastered using git for version control, collaboration, and project submissions.


🚀 Personal Growth
Time Management: Balanced multiple projects under strict deadlines.
Resilience: Learned to keep pushing forward through challenging tasks and failures.
Teamwork: Engaged in peer coding sessions, feedback, and group challenges.
Problem-Solving: Developed logical thinking to approach coding problems efficiently.


🔥 Biggest Challenges
Understanding and using pointers without segmentation faults.
Managing memory with malloc and avoiding leaks.
Debugging code under time pressure during evaluations.
Writing clean and efficient shell scripts.
These challenges taught me the value of patience, persistence, and the importance of thinking through the problem before coding.
