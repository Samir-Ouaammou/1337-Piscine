- Debugging segmentation faults and memory leaks.
- Writing clean, efficient, and error-free shell scripts.
- Managing time efficiently during intense evaluations.



## 🎯 Next Steps
With the foundation built during the Piscine, I am now focused on:
- Conquering advanced projects like **libft**, **ft_printf**, and **Born2beroot**.
- Improving my skills in system programming, process management, and system calls.
- Exploring data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming.
- Collaborating on open-source projects and contributing to the tech community.



## 🌟 Reflection
The **1337 Piscine** was more than just a bootcamp—it was a transformative experience. It taught me:
- How to learn through challenges and failures.
- The importance of patience, persistence, and discipline.
- That with hard work and consistency, no problem is unsolvable.
